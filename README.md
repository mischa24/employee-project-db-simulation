This project contains a relational database simulation using SQL, developed as part of academic coursework. It includes a simple company schema with `EMPLOYEE` and `PROJECT` tables, implemented in MySQL using phpMyAdmin.

## 📁 Files

- `erg_1_final.txt`: Full SQL script with table creation and data insertion
- `SQLQuery3.sql`: Additional SQL script with categories and countries (related or test table)
- `schema_screenshots/`: Includes visual structure from phpMyAdmin interface

## 🧱 Database Design

- `EMPLOYEE`: Stores employee information with primary key `employee_id`
- `PROJECT`: Stores project assignments and deadlines
- Uses `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and planned `FOREIGN KEY` relations

## 🛠 Technologies

- MySQL / phpMyAdmin
- Manual SQL scripting
- ER-style structure with normalized data

## 💡 Notes

Some syntax corrections may be required (e.g. `INSERT INFO` ➜ `INSERT INTO`, typo in `empolyee_id`), which are part of the academic debugging process.

## 🎓 Credits
